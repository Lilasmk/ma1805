// My emoji reflect multiple aspect of our personality traits, as the two eye triangles can reflect a deep perception, as it display awerness, knowledge and insight.This could imply a perceiption that cuts through illusion.Addiononally it withhall an analytical clarity between the mind and the spirit of the person.The straight line as the mouth, neither smiling or sad, reflect a equilibrium in the emotion, where there is balance and stability.The combination of them display a calm , detched mind that is subconsciouss of it serounding .

[02.movement](02.movement/index.html)
// For movement i spread a bnch of text in different languages, i decided to make it a bit of a reflection of my mind.The reason behind that is because i am trilanguagle and the languages can min different time and mixed in my brain. If you look precicly they come one after the other with arabic then french and last english, due to the orther i learn them across the years.The mess it goes on to is a bit like the mix going on in side my brain as i have all these words mixed with in it wwhich leads on to me thinking in the three languages at the same time.

[03multiples](03multiples/index.html)
// For multiples i decided to make a grid , then added 3 different shapes with different sizes in it.The reason behind this choise is to use the grid as our life going on day by day , year by year.Where as the shapes reflect specific events that happened could be big events that effected us emotionaly and changed us, the smalled one could be an event that happened and left a memory rathen an effect on us.

[04.media](04.media/index.html)
// For the media , i decided to import a special , which is me and my friend going on a walk in a place that brings back alot of memories at sunset time.Through this i capture the view with the sound of nature i we were walking up hill.Across this i wanted to display this meaningfull moment while enjoying the beautifull view back home.
